# Task Time Manager

Task Time Manager is a Flutter-based application designed to help you effectively manage your tasks. The app allows users to create tasks, move them between columns (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed), and track the time spent on each task. Users can also edit task details as needed.

## Features

- **Task Management**:
  - Create new tasks with customizable titles and descriptions.
  - Edit existing tasks to update details.
  - Move tasks between columns to reflect their progress (Note: Moving tasks between columns only updates the local database and does not update the server due to API limitations in free mode, so when you close and reopen the app, tasks return to their server positions).

  - **Time Tracking**:
    - Start and stop a timer for each task to record the time spent.
    - View total time spent on individual tasks.

  - **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - Drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between columns.
    - Clean and intuitive design for seamless task management.
